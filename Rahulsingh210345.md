# Smart Plug3.0

## Summary
I am going to build a smart plug3.0.This device will  allow users to remotely control and schedule the power to an electrical outlet through a smartphone app or voice assistant.y.A smart plug3.0 is way to learn about the inner workings of smart home technology and gain hands-on experience with electrical engineering and programming.

 
## Plan

 This Device can be a challenging and interesting project for individuals with an interest in electrical engineering, programming, and smart home technology. The process of creating a smart plug would involve designing and implementing a circuit to control the power to the outlet, writing software to control the device and integrate it with existing smart home systems, and testing and troubleshooting the device to ensure it functions correctly. Talking about Tools they are ESP wifi Module,AC to DC Converter,Measuring Voltage and Current,Mechanical Box etc.
