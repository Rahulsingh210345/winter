# Smart Plug3.0

## Summary
A smart plug is a device that can be built to allow users to remotely control and schedule the power to an electrical outlet through a smartphone app or voice assistant. The device would typically include a plug that can be inserted into any standard electrical outlet, and a small device that connects to the plug and allows the user to control the power to the outlet. The device could also be built with energy monitoring capabilities that allow users to track how much power their devices are using. Building a smart plug would require an understanding of electrical engineering, programming, and the ability to integrate with existing smart home systems.
 
## Plan
 Talking about Tools they are ESP wifi Module,AC to DC Converter,Measuring Voltage and Current,Mechanical Box etc.
 Because i building a smart plug can be a challenging and interesting project for individuals with an interest in electrical engineering, programming, and smart home technology. The process of creating a smart plug would involve designing and implementing a circuit to control the power to the outlet, writing software to control the device and integrate it with existing smart home systems, and testing and troubleshooting the device to ensure it functions correctly. Building a smart plug can be a great way to learn about the inner workings of smart home technology and gain hands-on experience with electrical engineering and programming.
