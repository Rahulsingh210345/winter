# Smart Plug

## Summary
I am going to build a smart plug.This device will  allow users to remotely control and schedule the power to an electrical outlet through a smartphone app or voice assistant.y.A smart plug3.0 is way to learn about the inner workings of smart home technology and gain hands-on experience with electrical engineering and programming.

 
## Plan
To create a Smart Plug3.0 following  using the specified components, I will follow these steps:

First I will make the Smart plug with remote monitoring (current, voltage, energy), control (automatic, manual), and notification.thenAfter I will connect wifi through
appliances remotely. No matter where you are, integrate your device with the web server ThenAfter I will attach the 	Espressif ESP8266 ESP-01ESP WiFi Module.ThenAfter I connect each other
