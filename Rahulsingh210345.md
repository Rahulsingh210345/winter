# Smart Plug3.0

## Summary
I am going to build a smart plug3.0.This device will  allow users to remotely control and schedule the power to an electrical outlet through a smartphone app or voice assistant.y.A smart plug3.0 is way to learn about the inner workings of smart home technology and gain hands-on experience with electrical engineering and programming.

 
## Plan
To create a Smart Plug3.0 following  using the specified components, I will follow these steps:

First I will make the Smart plug with remote monitoring (current, voltage, energy), control (automatic, manual), and notification.thenAfter I will first control appliances remotely. No matter where you are, integrate your device with the web server ThenAfter I will attach the 	Espressif ESP8266 ESP-01ESP WiFi Module.ThenAfter I will connect the 	5V 1 Amp Power Supply Board 220V AC to DC Converter. I will also use a switch to control the power. ThenAfter I will connect the 	Energy Meter HLW8012.Measuring Voltage and Current cables.ThenAfter will upload the necessary code to the Arduino Uno to control the smart Plug. that I am currently working on. This code will include instructions for detecting the presence of a human in the vicinity of the car and adjusting the car's movement accordingly. Then comes the testing part the Smart plug3.0
